Objective: Prevent incoming traffic from a hostile IP to a host via a host-based simple stateful firewall.


Scenario: You are a webserver administrator, and have noticed malicious traffic in your Linux webserver’s logs. The traffic is coming from a single IPv4 address, which is currently sending you HTTP HEAD request spam. While your webserver is patched, you still don’t want this IP accessing the server at all. 
 


To successfully complete this lab, you must:


1. Locate the malicious IP in the webserver logs
2. Block ONLY that IP from accessing the server (Beginner), OR
3. Block ONLY that IP from accessing TCP port 80 with a TCP reset (Advanced)
