All you need is a Linux webserver listening on TCP 80, and 8080 and some sort of client machine to run the checkcomplete script on the same LAN. It doesn't matter which webserver. 

The checkcomplete script will generate the HTTP HEAD requests and notify when the requests timeout or get a TCP reset. 

The checkcomplete script will ONLY accept an IPv4 address. No 'http://', no '*.local'. Just the IP of the webserver. Feel free to provide it to the user. 

Give the user shell access to both, and leave them alone.
