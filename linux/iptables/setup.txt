All you need is a Linux webserver listening on TCP 80, and 8080 and some sort of client machine to run the checkcomplete script on the same LAN. It doesn't matter which webserver. 

The checkcomplete script will generate the HTTP HEAD requests and notify when the requests timeout or get a TCP reset.

The checkcomplete script requires a command-line argument that consists of the URL for the webserver. 
Python 3, along with requests, is also required. 

Give the user shell access to both, and leave them alone.
